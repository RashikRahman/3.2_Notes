## Hey There, this repo contains my notes, assignments, projects, Q&A of Mid-Final exams. Hope this help you guys. 

**What you'll need?**

Basically you'll need to know how to use jupyter lab for this repo. All the course material(codes&nodes) are done in jupyter lab. All the lecture are very organized & issued with respective dates. Open the .ipynb files with jupyter lab and go through all the materials. 


## Enjoy!!
